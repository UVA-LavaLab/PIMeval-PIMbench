# K-means Clustering

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to divide $n$ input data points into $k$ number of clusterings. Associations are determined by finding the nearest mean between point and centroids, updating the point's location, and repeating the process for a specified number of times.

## Implementation Description

This repository contains three different implementations of the K-means benchmark:

1. CPU
2. GPU
3. PIM

### Baseline Implementation

CPU and GPU have been used as baselines.

#### CPU

The CPU variant of K-means has been implemented using standard C++ library and OpenMP for parallel execution.

#### GPU

The GPU variant leverages CUDA C++ Core Libaries (CCCL) to perform K-means clustering on NVIDIA GPU.

### PIM Implementation

The PIM variant is implemented using C++ and three different PIM architectures can be tested with this.

## Compilation Instructions for Specific Variants

### CPU Variant

To compile for the CPU variant, use:

```bash
cd baselines/CPU
make
```

### GPU Variant

To compile for the GPU variant, use:

```bash
cd baselines/GPU
make
```

*Note that the GPU Makefile currently uses SM_80, which is compatible with the A100. To run it on a different GPU, please manually change this in the makefile.

### PIM Variant

To compile for the PIM variant, use:

```bash
cd PIM
make
```

## Execution Instructions

### Running the Executable

After compiling, run the each executable with the following command that will run it for default parameters:

```bash
./km.out
```

To see help text on all usages and how to modify any of the input parameters, use following command:

```bash
./km.out -h
```
