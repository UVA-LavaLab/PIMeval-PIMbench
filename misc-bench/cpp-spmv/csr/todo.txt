## February
- Implement FP32 benchmarks
- Refactor input functions
- Implement better output system
- Make benchmark script

## December
Comparison:
- batched and packed BSR implementation (redSum)
  - needs scripts
- batched and not packed BSR implementation (redSum) 
  - (running)
- CSR on CPU
- packed CSR with CPU unpacking

if possible:
- packed CSR with redSum unpacking
- batched BSR with CPU summing
- batched packed BSR with CPU summing

side quests:
- [x] redo random generation in BSR spmv (implement nnz and randomSet)
