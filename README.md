![Contribution](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contribution-Welcome-blue) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

### Description
* PIMeval
  * A PIM simulation and evaluation framework implemented as a C++ library
  * Support various subarray-level bit-serial, subarray-level bit-parallel and bank-level PIM architectures
  * Support both vertical and horizontal data layouts
  * Support multi-PIM-core programming model and resource management
  * Support high-level functional simulation with a set of PIM architecture independent APIs
  * Support low-level micro-ops programming for modeling architecture details
  * Support performance and energy modeling with detailed stats tracking
  * Support multi-threaded simulation for runtime
* PIMbench
  * A rich set of PIM benchmark applications on top of the PIMeval functional simulation and evaluation framework

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone <url_to_your_fork>
cd PIMeval-PIMbench/
make -j<n_proc>
cd /PIMbench/<application_dir>/PIM
./<application_executable_name>.out
```

  * `cpp-dot-prod`: Dot product
  * `cpp-prefixsum`: Prefix sum of a vector
  * `cpp-sad`: Sum of absolute difference
  * `cpp-vec-arithmetic`: Vector arithmetic
  * `cpp-vec-comp`: Vector comparison
  * `cpp-vec-div`: Vector division
  * `cpp-vec-logical`: Vector logical operations
  * `cpp-vec-mul`: Vector multiplication
  * `cpp-vec-popcount`: Vector popcount
  * `cpp-vec-broadcast-popcnt`: Vector broadcast and pop count
* Bit-serial micro-program evaluation framework
  * `bit-serial`
* Functional tests
  * `tests`

### How To Build
* Run `make` at root directory or subdirectories
  * `make perf`: Build with `-Ofast` for performance measurement (default)
  * `make debug`: Build with `-g` and `-DDEBUG` for debugging and printing verbose messages
<!--
  * `make dramsim3_integ`: Enable DRAMsim3 related code with `-DDRAMSIM3_INTEG`
-->
* Multi-threaded building
  * `make -j<n_proc>`
* Specify simulation target
  * `make PIM_SIM_TARGET=PIM_DEVICE_BITSIMD_V` (default)
  * `make PIM_SIM_TARGET=PIM_DEVICE_FULCRUM`
  * `make PIM_SIM_TARGET=PIM_DEVICE_BANK_LEVEL`
* Build with OpenMP
  * `make USE_OPENMP=1`
  * Guard any `-fopenmp` with this flag in Makefile used by a few applications

<!--
### About DRAMsim3 Integration
* DRAMsim3 related code are guarded with DRAMSIM3_INTEG flag
  * Requires `make dramsim3_integ`
* Below is needed for dramsim3_integ for now
```bash
# Build dramsim3
git clone https://github.com/fasiddique/DRAMsim3.git
cd DRAMsim3/
git checkout benchmark
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
# Build PIM functional simulator
git clone <url_to_this_repo>
cd pim-func-sim
export DRAMSIM3_PATH=<path_to_DRAMSIM3>
make -j
```
